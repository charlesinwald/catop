# System Monitor Application with Rust

This project aims to utilize the 'bottom' crate for developing a real-time system monitoring application on Linux systems.

## Objectives
- Leverage 'bottom' for gathering system metrics.
- Implement a terminal-based user interface for real-time monitoring.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility across Linux distributions.

More details on the architecture and implementation plan will be added as the project progresses.
